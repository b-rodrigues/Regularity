Description: Regularity is a friendly regex builder inspired by Ruby's
    Regularity library that is designed to work with R's magrittr. The library
    is based around using simple verbs (StartsWith, Then, OneOrMore) to
    construct regex strings. Regularity also recognises the special identifiers
    digit, lowercase, uppercase, letter, alphanumeric, whitespace, space, tab
    as singular or plural, e.g. digit and digits can both be used
